# Python-Challenge

The Folder contain two parts of the challenge **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.

As per the instruction it contain a main.py in both the folders and folders named resources containing the .csv file and a Analysis folder which contain the output of the main.py script in the form of .txt file.

* For the PyBank challenge the output has perfectly came out into the txt file as well as on the terminal.
* For the PyPoll challenge the output has came on into to the txt file as well as on the terminal.
* Hope you get all the point as  I have commented each line  in the script.
* I have open the same .csv file several time in order to solve the problem in different ways, first I made a list for all  the data just to count the total months and total votes. And open the .csv file again and done all the rest of the calculation without making a list and directly applying "for loop" into the code.

Apart form that challenge was a great help for boosting my mind and helped me a lot to understand the core function and the library of the python. So, it was a pleasure doing the challenge and eager to do the next challenge.

I did have an issue with the file directory, like when I copy my file to Disk D: (Which is not my main os disk ) when I run it on the Visual Code it gives me an error of no such directory. But when I run it on the python terminal it runs perfect. I don't have any idea why did I face that problem but, if you have the same problem please try to run in directly on the python terminal or copy it into your main OS disk.
