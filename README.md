# Python-Challenge

The Folder contain two parts of the challenge **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.

As per the instruction it contain a main.py in both the folders and folders named resources containing the .csv file and a Analysis folder which contain the output of the main.py script in the form of .txt file.

* For the PyBank challenge the output has perfectly came out into the txt file as well as on the terminal.
* For the PyPoll challenge the output has came on into to the txt file as well as on the terminal but is has some garbage value / some extra output displayed for the winner candidate part. It shows the sum of voter ID and the county name. But it does give away the winner candidate name in the output. I was confuse with the error and it wasn't much of a help so i have leave it that way or else it I would be left with changing my other codes.
* Hope you get all the point as  I have commented each line  in the script.
* I have open the same .csv file several time in order to solve the problem in different ways, first I made a list for all  the data just to count the total months and total votes. And open the .csv file again and done all the rest of the calculation without making a list and directly applying "for loop" into the code.

Apart form that challenge was a great help for boosting my mind and helped me a lot to understand the core function and the library of the python. So, it was a pleasure doing the challenge and eager to do the next challenge.
